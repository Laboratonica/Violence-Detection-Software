# Violence-Detection-Software
VDS should be able to: detect violence and send notifications with all the info to the right emergency service so te time of responce should be at least one phone call  shorter. I am new to coding(read-clueless...or  basicaly codeless) but- i would like to see this idea finds its makers who ever may they be- cos i simply do not know where to start -  (just scrached the surface of html,CSS and JS...so yap i am far from the start line)  why waste time., when there are people who could probably be done with it- before i knew where should i start :) What are  your thoughts?
